# Python Scripts for Custom CPU in Logisim-evolution

This project includes a set of Python scripts designed for a custom CPU created in Logisim-evolution. The scripts are specialized for the following functionalities:

- Generating ROM control for hex displays (3 in sequence).
- A 'bios' for the ROM, controlled by the instruction register/decoder.
- A programmer for writing and compiling code to be loaded into the RAM.

## About the Project

The architecture of this machine is based on Ben Eater's "8-bit breadboard computer" tutorial, with several modifications and changes implemented throughout the development process.

### Current Status and Future Plans

The project is currently at a stage where it supports basic operations. Future expansions are planned to include:
- Support for branch logic.
- Handling input and basic display functionalities.
- Potential development of a 'pong' game.

### Note on Code Organization

The code provided in this repository is not extensively organized or designed for widespread use. It is primarily uploaded as an example or a reference. Plans are in place to eventually include the Logisim save file for those interested in exploring or modifying the project.
